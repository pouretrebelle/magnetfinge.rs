## :raised_hands: Make it work locally

We like [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for dependency management, installation instructions can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

- `yarn start` - run in development mode on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- `yarn run build` - build site

## :rocket: Deploy it

The site is deployed to [magnetfinge.rs](http://magnetfinge.rs/) using Github Pages from the `docs` folder. The app can be updated by running `yarn run build` and then committing with a `:rocket:` commit message.
